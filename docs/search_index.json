URL: http://someurl BugReports: http://someurl gotchas/must do’s: no period at end of Title! single quote words in the Description that are likely to not be known in a simple spell checker. ABSOLUTELY make sure to include url for where the source code is and where to report bugs/issues. Seriously, this is not a joke. I do not use packages that don’t have URLs. 4.2 Code (R/) The R/ folder contains any number of .R files. It’s worth thinking about organization, see http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html#r-organising for more. 4.3 Namespaces (NAMESPACE) The NAMESPACE file contains: what to import from othe packages what to export (expose publicly), available via :: note that internal fxns are still available via ::: what does importFrom() mean? how is it different from import() Hot tips If you run into namespace problems, delete the lines in NAMESPACE and re-document the package if you accidentally delete the NAMESPACE file, re-document it’s a good place to look for: what you’re exporting and what you are not exporting same for importing 4.4 Object documentation (man/) man/ contains files with extension .Rd. You should not be editing these by hand. Use roxygen2 package with documentation associated with your code in .R files. 4.5 Vignettes (vignettes/) Vignettes are typically longer form examples/documentation on your package, and are linked to on the CRAN page for each package. See 10.3 for more. 4.6 Tests (tests/) Tests help you make sure your package does what you expect it to do, including as you make changes. See 8 for more. 4.7 Data (data/) data/ holds package data, used in your package functions, and optionally exposed to the user. 4.8 Complied Code (src/) Typically C or C++ code … too much detail for now. This is typically the problem when you see a bunch of stuff printed to the console when you have package installation problems - once a binary is available installation is sorted. 4.9 Installed files (inst/) Holds various files used by the package, e.g., inst/examples - files you want to use in examples that are not R objects, e.g., csv files You can access these files with system.file(&quot;examples/file.csv&quot;, package = &quot;your_package&quot;) "],

Any problems? report back 5.2 Functions in a package In a real R package you DO NOT want to export all functions in the package. RStudio/devtools/usethis/etc. do put exportPattern(&quot;^[^\\\\.]&quot;) in your NAMESPACE file by default. Important: Make sure to remove this and explicitly export functions that you want users to use with RStudio buttons or devtools::document() or similar. "],

You want to be able to edit code, then run/test it, modify, rerun, modify, etc. until you are happy with it. For some this may mean working in an IDE (RStudio) - for others this means a text editor and console - for others maybe Vim or Emacs. Get used to the keyboard shortcuts or buttons to make this flow easy and quick. devtools::load_all() (or equivalent buttons/shortcuts in IDE) is your friend - though beware you still want to check your package outside of a load all context (See 9) 6.2 Code 6.2.1 Exercise Write you own function Write a function Put it in a file in your R package 6.3 Docs Time to document your function! Above your function start each line with #'. There’s many, many options for documenting functions. 6.3.1 Exercise Let’s do a minimal set: Title Export tag Parameter definitions Return tag Examples #&#39; Multiply a number by 2 #&#39; #&#39; @export #&#39; @param x a numeric value. required #&#39; @return a number #&#39; @examples #&#39; multiply2(x = 5) multiply2 &lt;- function(x) { stopifnot(is.numeric(x)) x * 2 } 6.4 Generate documentation In RStudio push the document button or keyboard shortcut, or on the command line run devtools::document() or similar. Notice what state your NAMESPACE file is in before and after. 6.5 Install the package Now install the package. in RStudio: Install and Restart command line: devtools::install() restart your R session load your package library(packagename) Can you run your function? if not, let’s dig in and sort it out 6.6 Yay!

For R packages, a safe bet is MIT Karl Broman has some good advice on choosing a license for your R package. 10.2 continuous integration CI is integral to a healthy package workflow. The “continuous” part means each deployment to github/gitlab is checked. Check out travis and tic for R based helpers. 10.3 vignettes TLDR: if nothing else, you should have examples in your README, correct? Just make a vignette out of that. vignettes are super important - if users don’t know how to use your package they won’t use it. See R pkgs vignettes chapter for more. 10.4 resources if/when you run into trouble: Writing an R package from scratch - Hilary Parker Developing R packages - Jeff Leek stat545 - Write your own R package - Jenny Bryan’s statistics 545 class at UBC R package primer - Karl Boman Making Your First R Package - Fong Chun Chan R Package Development Pictorial - Matthew Denny Coursera course on building R packages R Packages by Hadley for a full treatment of the subject. From time to time you may need to reference CRAN’s Writing R Extensions. 10.5 CRAN/Bioconductor No experience with Bioconductor, though I can put you in touch with people that do. CRAN is a slippery target. devtools::release() makes this easier, reminding you to check many things that may get your package rejected. "],
