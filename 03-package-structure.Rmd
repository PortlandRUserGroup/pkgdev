## Code (`R/`)

The `R/` folder contains any number of `.R` files. 

It's worth thinking about organization, see <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html#r-organising> for more.

## Namespaces (`NAMESPACE`)

The `NAMESPACE` file contains:

* what to import from othe packages
* what to export (expose publicly), available via `::` 
    * note that internal fxns are still available via `:::`
* what does `importFrom()` mean? how is it different from `import()`

__Hot tips__

* If you run into namespace problems, delete the lines in `NAMESPACE` and re-document the package
* if you accidentally delete the `NAMESPACE` file, re-document
* it's a good place to look for: 
    * what you're exporting and what you are not exporting
    * same for importing
