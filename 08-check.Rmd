# Package checks {#package-checks}

Now that we've built an R package, we need to check it. 

Run R check often to make sure you 
aren't breaking something in your package. 

## RStudio

Keyboard shortchuts: shift + command + E (shift + ctrl + E)

OR use buttons

## command line

from your shell

```sh
Rscript -e 'devtools::check()'
```

OR from within R

```r
devtools::check()
```

OR with the newer package [rcmdcheck](https://github.com/r-lib/rcmdcheck)

```r
rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck()
```

## the really hard way

```sh
R CMD BUILD your_package_folder
R CMD CHECK your_package_name.tar.gz
```
