# Dependencies {#dependencies}

Dependencies in R package land means other R packages. 

There are (mostly) three types:

* Depends
* Imports
* Suggests

`Enhances` is used rarely

## Adding dependencies

- Add an entry in the `DESCRIPTION` file
- Add a declaration of what you are importing from the package:
    + all of the package, or (`@import package`)
    + certain functions (`@importFrom package function`)

You can do this manually or via `usethis::use_package('package_name')`

## Add a dependency to a package

```r
xxxx
```
