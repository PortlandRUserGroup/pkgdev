## Setup

Does everyone have `devtools` installed?

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Check out the devtools cheat sheet: <https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/package-development.pdf>

> note that devtools is being split into many pkgs, just be aware <https://github.com/r-lib/devtools#conscious-uncoupling>

## Why make an R package? {#package}

- the best way to organize code
- have function documentation
- have package documentation
- can have tests
- allow for namespacing
- make it easy to wrap compiled code
- good job skill
- if on CRAN, make your code useable by others

You'll be glad you moved your code into a package.
